    <p><span data-actor="GUARDS">GUARDS: He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SCENE">SCENE: "Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He quickly hides behind Shrek."</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="HEAD GUARD">HEAD GUARD: You there. Ogre!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SHREK">SHREK: Aye?</span></p>     
    <p><span data-actor="HEAD GUARD">HEAD GUAED: By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized to place you both under arrest and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SHREK">SHREK: Oh, really? You and what army?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SCENE">SCENE: "He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and begins walking back to his cottage."</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="DONKEY">DONKEY: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SHREK">SHREK: Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="DONKEY">DONKEY: Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back here? Those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up, and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SHREK">SHREK: Oh, that's great. Really.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="DONKEY">DONKEY: Man, it's good to be free.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SHREK">SHREK: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="DONKEY">DONKEY: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SCENE">SCENE: "Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very loudly."</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="DONKEY">DONKEY: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SHREK">SHREK: Why are you following me?</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="DONKEY">DONKEY: I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have faith...</span></p>
    <p><span data-actor="SHREK">SHREK: Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't have any friends.</span></p>
